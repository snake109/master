# CCT High School
This is a web-project that I made at the end of High School. It was made in less than one year (Feb/17 - Dec/17), only by me.


## Needings
For editing the files locally, you only need a simple text editor, like Notepad++, Brackets, or some stuff like this.


## Request
The initial request was to made a shopping website, with or without some complements. For sure, we made a group on this and created a large amount of stuff, like fictionary Company, adresses, etc.


## Versions
Along of time, something can be added in the code, and it's gonna be controlled in the 'Test' branch.
